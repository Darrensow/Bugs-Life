# Welcome to BugsLife. 
<br>

This project is developed by my teammate and I as an assignment for Data Structure.

## How to Use Git with Netbeans?
<br>

1. Please view this video (0:10 - 2:54) on how to clone the remote repository into your desktop. https://youtu.be/aBVOAnygcZw

2. The link to the remote repository is https://github.com/Darrensow/Bugs-Life.git
   
3. Once you follow all the steps in the video, you can see all files are cloned from the remote repo into your local repo!

## How to Get Latest Updates from Teammate?
<br>

1. Whenever you make some changes and push into the remote repo. Remember to notify your members in the group.

2. Perform one of the option:

#### Option 1: Get latest update and merge with your current work
Let's say you have already code some new stuff, and you realize your teammate had commit some changes ahead you, and you wish to get the changes at the mean time dock with your current work.
- Go to Git -> Fetch
- Then, go to Git -> Rebase -> 'Select the branch (origin/master)'


#### Option 2: Just get all latest updates
If your teammate had made some changes, and you just purely wants to accept all changes,then you should perform pull operation.
- Go to Git -> Pull -> 'Select the branch (master)' -> Pull


3. Then, you can see the latest updates are copied into your local repo.

## What to do when you want to update changes in the repo?
<br>

1. If you made some changes, then you need to commit the changes before you can push it to remote repo.

2. Go to Git -> Commit.
- Choose ***only*** the file you had made changes, and leave a message of your commit.

3. After committing, go to Git -> Push.
- Select Configured Repo Location, select master branch.

4. You can log into github on the web and see your changes there!
