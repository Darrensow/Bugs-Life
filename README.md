# Welcome to BugsLife. 
<br>
This project is developed by my teammate and I as an assignment for Data Structure.

## How to Use Git with Netbeans?
<br>
1. Please view this video (0:10 - 2:54) on how to clone the remote repository into your desktop. https://youtu.be/aBVOAnygcZw

2. The link to the remote repository is https://github.com/Darrensow/Bugs-Life.git
   
3. Once you follow all the steps in the video, you can see all files are cloned from the remote repo into your local repo!

# How to work with your teammate?
<br>
1. Whenever someone make some changes and push into the remote repo. Remember to notify your members in the group.

2. If your teammate had made some changes, then you must first pull from the remote repo to get the latest version.
- Go to Git -> Pull -> 'Select the branch (master)' -> Pull

3. Then, you can see the latest updates are copied into your local repo.

## What to do when you want to update changes in the repo?
<br>
1. If you made some changes, then you need to commit the changes before you can push it to remote repo.

2. Go to Git -> Commit.
- Choose ***only*** the file you had made changes, and leave a message of your commit.

3. After committing, go to Git -> Push.
- Select Configured Repo Location, select master branch.

4. You can log into github on the web and see your changes there!
